"I am Rasool Ferasat, PhD in Sport Biomechanics, with over eleven years of academic and research experience in human motion analysis. My expertise focuses on gait analysis, core stability, electromyography (EMG), kinetics, and kinematics. I have contributed to multiple publications exploring injury prevention, performance optimization, and the biomechanics of sports and functional movement.

I currently teach Sport Biomechanics, Human Anatomy, and Pathomechanics of Human Movement at the undergraduate and graduate levels. I am also a co-founder of the Dayan Health and Sport Rehabilitation Center, where we integrate biomechanical assessment, rehabilitation, and exercise design for athletes and the general population.

My research interests include human motion biomechanics, gait analysis, sports injury prevention, and core stability. I am passionate about collaborating with interdisciplinary teams and advancing the global understanding of human movement.
